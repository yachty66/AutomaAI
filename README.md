# Goal

- [ ] seperate prompt from sample 
- [ ] run bot.py samplefile.txt for starting the process  

Goal ist to get the last 8 bitcoin prices.

Next step

He just has a module for fixing the error which is appearing. What about 

I am thinking off something like. i am to much in this twitter bubble. i am pretty dependent to that.

AI hacker mode. Github can be a good system fr

next step is to either open source this or to build a product for it. For now I will proceed while still being open source on it. Now its time to fucking build. I am a little bit stuck on ideas for what to do next.I dont know. What can I do? What can I do? Write an. 

VSC extension which prompts up and than. You all want AI shit? I am going to build.

Autonomous AI programmer (AutomaAI) UPDATE

I spend this morning building a system capable of completing the simple task of creating a Python Script which is writing "Hello World" into a text file. For now the prompt for the task is written in a text file. The prompt is "Create a Python script which writes "Hello World" into a text file.". The script parses the prompt and adds a additional prompt so that the response will be in a expected format which is than also possible to parse. A response looks like:

```python
Filename: output.py

Script code:

with open("hello.txt", "w") as file:
file.write("Hello World!")

Run: output.py
```

From this response I am able to strategically parse out the necessary information. I have three functions:

- filename
- script
- run

The filename parses the filename of the response and creates this file, the script method parses the content which the script should contain and adds them to the file and the run method is running the just created script.

Next steps? This was a really trivial task but it shows really good how capable the system is. Now the challenge is to scale this system up to use it for more complex tasks.
 



Goal is to feed the code which I get back into the into the system. I need root rights of files. I want to build an AI which is able to program their own programs. I want to build a more advanced coding assistant AI. The AI should be able to solve more complex problems. I just need to give here the knowledge about the file system basically. I need to give here the rights of creating files. This is going to be wild. I should create something where the AI is creating his own file and than executes also some code. This all could be embedded into visual studio code. I want to empower porgrammers. Will i be able to create an AI for creating automatically files in vsc? challenge accepted. everything comes down to automation. automation == progress.

## Goal:

Create a Python script which is creating a file and than it writes in this file "Hello World".

Starting point is a empty folder and a prompt. And the program of course. Well what I need is a VSC extension. The extension is asking: 

- What do you wanna do? 
- Create a Python script which writes "Hello World" into a text file. 

I just need to parse the output of the response from the API. I can first create a python script with the commands.

Fuck yeah. I am going to build a startupd. 


The future from here on is now to
