# Goal

Goal is to feed the code which I get back into the into the system. I need root rights of files. I want to build an AI which is able to program their own programs. I want to build a more advanced coding assistant AI. The AI should be able to solve more complex problems. I just need to give here the knowledge about the file system basically. I need to give here the rights of creating files. This is going to be wild. I should create something where the AI is creating his own file and than executes also some code. This all could be embedded into visual studio code. I want to empower porgrammers. Will i be able to create an AI for creating automatically files in vsc? challenge accepted. everything comes down to automation. automation == progress.

## Goal:

Create a Python script which is creating a file and than it writes in this file "Hello World".

Starting point is a empty folder and a prompt. And the program of course. Well what I need is a VSC extension. The extension is asking: 

- What do you wanna do? 
- Create a Python script which writes "Hello World" into a text file. 

I just need to parse the output of the response from the API. I can first create a python script with the commands.

Fuck yeah. I am going to build a startupd.
