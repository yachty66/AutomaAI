Create a Python script which writes "Hello World" into a text file. Write your response in a way that every time you create a script you write first the filename and than the script. At the end write which file needs to be executed so that the program is working like:

Filename: test.py

Script code:

print("hello world")

Run: test.py 

Write your response in the same format with 

"Filename:", "Script code:" and "Run:"
